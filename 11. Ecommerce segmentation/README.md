# 11. Ecommerce segmentation
Data Analysis projects

11. Users segmentation in the online store in order to create personal offers. Used standart RFM analysis with ML. Formulated and tested statistical hypotheses. 
Considered average check, average item price, average amount of goods in the check, the average number of orders per customer. Automatic RFM segmentation was performed by features:
- Date of last purchase
- Purchase frequency
- Order value.
Counted clients in every segment: core, loyal, whales, rookies ,slipping, regular. I gave some basic recommendations for actions with segments.
