0. Yandex music analisys. Research if there are any differencies in music listening between Moscow and Saint-Petersburg users.

Work hypothesis:
- music in two cities — Moscow and St. Petersburg-is listened to in different modes;
- lists of the ten most popular genres on Monday morning and Friday evening have characteristic differences;
- the population of the two cities prefers different musical genres.

Overall result

Moscow and St. Petersburg have similar tastes: popular music prevails everywhere. At the same time, there is no dependence of preferences on the day of the week in each individual city — people constantly listen to what they like. But between cities in the context of days a week, there is a mirror image relative to Wednesday: Moscow listens more on Monday and Friday, and St. Petersburg on the contrary - more on Wednesday, but less on Monday and Friday.

As a result, the first hypothesis is confirmed, the second hypothesis is confirmed, and the third is not confirmed.
