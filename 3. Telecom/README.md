3. Determination of a promising tariff for a telecom company.  Clients are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings the most money. It is necessary to analyze customer behavior and draw a conclusion - which tariff is better.

Conclusions:
- revealed a more profitable tariff
- it is established that revenue does not depend on the region - in Moscow and in the Regions, people spend the same amount of money.
- we have calculated the average revenue for each tariff
- identified a tariff for which, on average, the duration of calls, the amount of traffic and messages is higher
- there is seasonality, which is expressed in reduced use of all services in January-February with an increasing trend towards the end of the year.
