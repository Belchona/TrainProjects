Data Analysis projects

10. Analyze and prepare an action plan to retain clients of the fitness club. Namely:
learn to predict the likelihood of a churn (at the next month's level) for each client;
to form typical portraits of users: to highlight several of the brightest groups and to characterize their main properties;
analyze the main features that most strongly affect the outflow;
formulate key findings and develop recommendations to improve the quality of work with clients
