# 10. Fitness churn
Data Analysis projects

10. Analyze and prepare an action plan to retain clients of the fitness club. 
Namely:
- learn to predict the likelihood of a churn (at the next month's level) for each client
- to form typical portraits of users: to highlight several of the brightest groups and to characterize their main properties
- analyze the main features that most strongly affect the outflow
- formulate key findings and develop recommendations to improve the quality of work with clients


Key recommendations for marketing:

- to look for partners near fitness center
- the users located near the fitness center, but not from partners to interview about the employer and offer the employer partnership
- to offer from partners of the action "bring a friend"
- to promote additional services of the fitness center, to instill a habit of spending money on them
- to promote group classes among those who are not inclined to visit them
- to track the drop in attendance compared to the previous month. Motivate fitness sessions at least 2 times a week
- promote subscription renewal approximately 1-1. 5 months before its end
- increase the attractiveness of long-term subscriptions. For example, give discounts on additional services
- offer the "bring a friend" promotion to customers with an expiring subscription
