Data Analysis projects

5. Airline analytics. 
Choose the top 10 cities by the number of flights; 
Build graphs: aircraft models and the number of flights, cities and the number of flights, top 10 cities and the number of flights
Draw conclusions for each of the graphs and explain the result.

CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF FLIGHTS ON AIRPLANES

Most flights (>4000) were made on the Bombardier CRJ-200, Cessna 208 Caravan, and Sukhoi Superject-100 models.
Next in descending order of the number of flights are the Airbus and Boeing models (960-300 flights). Probably, the models from the top 3 are intended for frequent, and possibly short-term flights. Therefore, the difference in the number of flights is so huge.

CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS BY CITY

More than 120 flights a day in Moscow
Between 20 and 40 flights a day in Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities, less than 20 flights a day
No additional conclusions can be drawn from this data. It might be possible to deduce the dependence of the number of flights on geo and population, but this is not required by the task conditions.

CONCLUSIONS FROM THE TOP 10 CITIES WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF FLIGHTS

on the graph, we see on a larger scale the average number of flights in descending
order in the first place Moscow, which has 4 times more flights than in St. Petersburg (total 129 flights on average)
in the second place St. Petersburg with 31 flights on average
in the 3rd place Novosibirsk with an average of 17 flights
Next, with a slight difference, the remaining top 10 participants are Krasnoyarsk, Yekaterinburg, Rostov-on-don, Perm, Bryansk, Sochi, Ulyanovsk with an average number of flights from 9 to 11.
