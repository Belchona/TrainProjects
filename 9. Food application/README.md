# 9. Food application
Data Analysis projects

9. For a startup that sells food, you need to figure out how mobile app users behave. Explore your sales funnel.
Then examine the results of the A / A / B experiment. The designers wanted to change the fonts throughout the application, and the managers were afraid that the users would be unusual. We agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A / A / B test.

Description:
You work for a startup that sells food. You need to understand how users of your mobile app behave. Study the sales funnel. Find out how users reach the purchase. How many users reach the purchase, and how many "get stuck" in the previous steps? What is it?
Designers wanted to change the fonts in the entire app, and managers were afraid that users would be unfamiliar. We agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. Users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control groups with old fonts and one experimental group with new fonts. Find out which font is better.

Conclusions:
Significant differences compared to the control groups were found in the A / B test and A2 / B comparison. In the test group, 47% reach the successful payment screen, and in the control group - 48%. The differences are significant. Therefore, the new font is worse than in the control group. The experiment failed.
